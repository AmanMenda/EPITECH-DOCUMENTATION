At Epitech, the default text editor is our good old emacs. However Visual Studio Code is interfering in our relationship with emacs and is taking over from its many extensions and style.

One more time, if you have used the kayofeld script, you are a winner. The script installs emacs and configures the necessary.
Really good kayofeld. ðŸ˜œ

For the installation of emacs with Epitech configuration, you can use the script available in this repository github [Epitech-emacs](https://github.com/Epitech/epitech-emacs). Go to this repository, clone him and follow the steps.

Emacs useful shortcuts you will use:
- coding style
- emacs config file
