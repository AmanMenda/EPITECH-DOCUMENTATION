Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development, created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows[clarification needed].

If you have used the kayofeld script, you are a winner. The script installs the git and configures the necessary.
Otherwise it's not complicated, just install the git package with your package manager :

On Debian / Ubuntu :
```
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
```

On Fedora :
```
$ sudo dnf install git-all
```

On Archlinux :
```
$ sudo pacman -Syu git
```

Thanks to Linus Torvalds.
