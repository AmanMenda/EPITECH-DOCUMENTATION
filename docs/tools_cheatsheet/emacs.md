At Epitech, the default text editor is our good old emacs. However, Visual Studio Code is interfering in our relationship with emacs and is taking over from its many extensions and style.

If you have used the [kayofeld script](https://github.com/kayofeld/script-installation-ordinateur-epitech), you are a `winner`.

For the installation of emacs with Epitech configuration, you can use the script available in this github repository [Epitech-emacs](https://github.com/Epitech/epitech-emacs).

Clone the repo with:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Epitech/epitech-emacs.git
```

For local installation, run:
```bash
$ ./INSTALL.sh local
```

For system-wide installation, run:
```bash
$ sudo ./INSTALL.sh system
```

There is an emacs configuration allowing you to avoid some standard errors present in the coding style. Download the following file.
